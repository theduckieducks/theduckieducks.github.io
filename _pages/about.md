The Duckie Ducks group 🦆 is a young pioneering research group at the School of Electronics, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EEECS) within Queen’s University Belfast, proudly established in 2023. The group is led by Dr. Thai Son Mai, a dedicated leader whose commitment to cutting-edge research is evident through his consistent publication record in leading venues and prestigious Core A\* conferences. Our collaborative work extends beyond conventional boundaries, not only deeply exploring novel aspects and advanced methodologies within Artificial Intelligence and Data Mining, but critically, we provide interdisciplinary approaches, frequently forging connections and combining these sophisticated computational fields with other fundamental scientific disciplines such as Physics, Chemistry, and Biology 🔬. Our dynamic group is primarily composed of talented PhD students who, under Dr. Mai's guidance, wholeheartedly share this unwavering commitment to producing high-impact, transformative research. This dedication fuels our rapid growth and innovation. The distinctive name, 'Duckie Ducks,' embodies the core philosophy of our lab members: to cultivate minds that are perpetually fresh and open, to foster an insatiable curiosity about the world around us, and to maintain an unyielding passion for scientific discovery and advancement. This unique approach is already yielding remarkable results; in a remarkably short span of less than two years from beginning time, the group has celebrated significant achievements, including the acceptance of 3 papers at AAAI, 1 paper at DAC, 1 paper at NeurIPS, and 1 TMLR paper (which notably achieved featured certification) 🏆. These accomplishments underscore our commitment, with all of these impactful papers being published in highly selective and leading venues within their respective fields.
