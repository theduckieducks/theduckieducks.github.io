The Duckie Ducks group 🦆 is a research group at EEECS, Queen’s University Belfast, established in 2023. It is led by Dr. Thai Son Mai, who actively publishes his work in leading venues and Core A\* conferences. Our work not only focuses on novel aspects and methods in AI and Data Mining, but also often combines these fields with other disciplines such as Physics, Chemistry, and Biology 🔬. Our group consists primarily of PhD students who share this commitment to high-impact research and is growing rapidly. The name of the group represents the philosophy of our lab members: to keep the mind fresh, remain curious about everything, and be passionate about science. This approach is already delivering results; in less than two years, our group has published 3 AAAI papers, 1 DAC paper, 1 NeurIPS paper, and 1 TMLR paper (with featured certification) 🏆, all published in leading venues within the field.
