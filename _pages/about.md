The Duckie Ducks group is a research group at EEECS, Queen's University Belfast, established in 2023. It is led by Dr. Thai Son Mai, who actively publishes his work in leading venues and Core A\* conferences. Our work not only focuses on novel aspects and methods in AI and Data Mining, but also often combines these fields with other disciplines such as Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. Our group consists primarily of PhD students who share this commitment to high-impact research and is growing rapidly.
