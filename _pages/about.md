<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

The Duckie Ducks group is a research group at EEECS, Queen's University Belfast, established in 2023. It is led by Dr. Thai Son Mai, who actively publishes his work in leading venues and Core A* conferences. Our work not only focuses on novel aspects and methods in AI and Data Mining, but also often combines these fields with other disciplines such as Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. Our group consists primarily of PhD students who share this commitment to high-impact research and is growing rapidly.
